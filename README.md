## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

For me this challenge was more about going over a lot of the things i learned in previous challenges to strengthen my knowledge.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing flexbox and also CSS Grid, even though i didn't use it for this challenge

### Useful resources

- [Top border color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-color) - I didn't know you could add color to only one side of a border, this helped me with that.
